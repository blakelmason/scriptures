      <p>"as a branch be grafted into the true vine"</p>
      <p>
        An interesting phrase to use here, because it is preceded by Mormon
        mentioning when the Savior visits the Nephites. I believe this
        "grafting" is explained by the events of the Savior's visit to the
        Nephites. They are purified, become one with him, and given immense
        power to do all things and mighty miracles in his name. The miracles are
        astounding that are mentioned.

      <p>
        I know of no miracles like this currently happening in the church. I
        think we are in the "pouring out the Spirit" phase to prepare us for
        when Jesus visits us again, and I believe the grafting has yet to happen
        for us as a people.{' '}

        is the "grafting" for the Nephites, and I wonder if an event will happen
        just like this for the saints in the New Jerusalem. I believe it will.
